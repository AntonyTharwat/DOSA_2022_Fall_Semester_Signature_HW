### DESCRIPTION OF THE EXERCISE
Design a .Net application by which a phone operator at a restaurant can manage table reservations: 
- Can manage the tables at the restaurant, how many chair on each tables.. etc. 
- Can list available tables (depending on the time) 
- Can assembly reservation by setting the time of the arrival, the number of guests, and
name of the person who books the table. 
- Can list the daily menu 
Besides the code, you should create a UML Use-Case diagram, UML Class diagram and 2 UML Sequence diagram
### SOLUTION, EXPLANATION
The first question that comes to mind at the beginning of developing a new software application, where we have a set of requirements, is how to convert from textual to model requirements. During the course this semester, specifically, Lecture 4. we learned the typical steps of specifications as follows: 
- Divide the text into discrete sentences.
- Mark all nouns. They will be class names and attributes.
- Mark all verbs. They will be the functions.
- Fine-tune the results.


After that, I can develop a simple C# code depending on the basics of C# programming language and also create different types of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, including (Class diagrams – sequence diagrams – State diagrams).
